# Sidecar

The sidecar component of Thanos gets deployed along with a Prometheus instance. It implements Thanos' Store API on top of Prometheus' remote-read API and advertises itself as a data source to the cluster. Thereby queriers in the cluster can treat Prometheus servers as yet another source of time series data without directly talking to its APIs.
Additionally, the sidecar uploads TSDB blocks to an object storage bucket as Prometheus produces them. This allows Prometheus servers to be run with relatively low retention while their historic data is made durable and queryable via object storage.

Prometheus servers connected to the Thanos cluster via the sidecar are subject to a few limitations for safe operations:

* The minimum Prometheus version is 2.0
* The `external_labels` section of the configuration implements is in line with the cluster's [labeling scheme](/docs-for-labeling-schemas)
* The `--storage.tsdb.min-block-duration` and `--storage.tsdb.max-block-duration` must be set to equal values to disable local compaction. The default of `2h` is recommended.

The retention is recommended to not be lower than three times the block duration. This achieves resilience in the face of connectivity issues to the object storage since all local data will remain available within the Thanos cluster. If connectivity gets restored the backlog of blocks gets uploaded to the object storage.

```


## Reloader Configuration

Thanos can watch changes in Prometheus configuration and refresh Prometheus configuration if `--web.enable-lifecycle` enabled.

You can configure watching for changes in directory via `--reloader.rule-dir=DIR_NAME` flag.

Thanos sidecar can watch `--reloader.config-file=CONFIG_FILE` configuration file, evalute environment variables found in there and produce generated config in `--reloader.config-envsubst-file=OUT_CONFIG_FILE` file.
