# Store

The store component of Thanos implements the Store API on top of historical data in an object storage bucket. It acts primarily as an API gateway and therefore does not need significant amounts of local disk space. It joins a Thanos cluster on startup and advertises the data it can access.
It keeps a small amount of information about all remote blocks on local disk and keeps it in sync with the bucket. This data is generally safe to delete across restarts at the cost of increased startup times.

```
$ thanos store \
    --tsdb.path        "/local/state/data/dir" \
    --gcs.bucket       "example-bucket" \
    --cluster.peers    "thanos-cluster.example.org"
```

In general about 1MB of local disk space is required per TSDB block stored in the object storage bucket.

                                0 no trace will be sent periodically, unless
                                forced by baggage item. See

                                (StoreAPI). Make sure this address is routable
                                from other components if you use gossip,
                                'grpc-advertise-address' is empty and you
                                require cross-node connection.
      --grpc-advertise-address=GRPC-ADVERTISE-ADDRESS  
                                Explicit (external) host:port address to
                                advertise for gRPC StoreAPI in gossip cluster.
                                If empty, 'grpc-address' will be used.
      --http-address="0.0.0.0:10902"  
                                Listen host:port for HTTP endpoints.
      --cluster.address="0.0.0.0:10900"  
                                Listen ip:port address for gossip cluster.
      --cluster.advertise-address=CLUSTER.ADVERTISE-ADDRESS  
                                Explicit (external) ip:port address to advertise
                                for gossip in gossip cluster. Used internally
                                for membership only.
      --cluster.peers=CLUSTER.PEERS ...  
                                Initial peers to join the cluster. It can be
                                either <ip:port>, or <domain:port>. A lookup
                                resolution is done only at the startup.
      --cluster.peers-file=/peers/file
                                File containing a list of peers, one on each
                                line, to join the cluster. Each peer should be
                                in the format <ip:port>.
      --cluster.gossip-interval=<gossip interval>  
                                Interval between sending gossip messages. By
                                lowering this value (more frequent) gossip
                                messages are propagated across the cluster more
                                quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth.
                                Default is used from a specified network-type.
      --cluster.pushpull-interval=<push-pull interval>

                                interval lower (more frequent) will increase
                                convergence speeds across larger clusters at the
                                expense of increased bandwidth usage. Default is

      --cluster.refresh-interval=1m0s  
                                Interval for membership to refresh cluster.peers
                                state, 0 disables refresh.
      --cluster.secret-key=CLUSTER.SECRET-KEY  
                                Initial secret key to encrypt cluster gossip.
                                Can be one of AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 in

                                accounting the latency differences between
                                network types: local, lan, wan.
